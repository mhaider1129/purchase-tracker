# Purchase Frontend (Vite)

This project is built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and React.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies (includes Vite and the React plugin):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. If you previously saw `vite` is not recognized, re-run the install step to ensure dev dependencies are present on your PATH (Windows users may need a fresh terminal after installation).
3. Start the dev server with `npm start` or `npm run dev` (both call Vite).

### `npm start`
